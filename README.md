# Duck AI

Simple wrapper around [duck.ai](https://duck.ai) for ease of use in a dedicated window.

> Duck.ai is a free feature that allows you to have private conversations with 3rd-party AI chat models.
>
> Duck.ai does not record or store any of your chats, and your conversations are not used to train chat models by DuckDuckGo or the underlying model providers (for example, Open AI and Anthropic).
